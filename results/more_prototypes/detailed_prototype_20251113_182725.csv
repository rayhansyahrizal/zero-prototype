ROCOv2_2023_test_000160,XR,"Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the strongest known risk factor for active tuberculosis (TB), and the risk of developing active TB in people living with HIV (PLWH) is 15–22 times higher than in people without HIV [1]. Active TB may develop at any stage of HIV infection, but the risk correlates negatively with CD4+ cells count. TB is the leading cause of morbidity, hospitalisations, and mortality in PLWH [1]. There were 214,000 deaths due to TB among HIV-positive people in 2020 worldwide, which accounted for 31.5% of all HIV-related deaths [1,2]. Therefore, it is recommended to screen for TB in HIV-positive patients, and for HIV infection in newly diagnosed TB patients [3,4,5]. Around 16% of all PLWH do not know that they are infected with HIV [1], and about 25% of incident HIV patients present to care with advanced disease [3]. Immunosuppression caused by HIV infection affects clinical and radiologic presentation of TB. Atypical TB presentation is often observed in the late stages of HIV infection [6,7,8,9]. Such atypical TB presentation in a person with HIV infection not yet diagnosed, may be challenging, as described below.

The MRI shows the classical symmetrical involvement of both thalami (with a target appearance) and symmetrical external capsular white matter affected. She had brainstem involvement (not shown) and was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone early. She survived with mild to moderate neurological sequelae. She was the first in her family to be genetically confirmed as positive for a RANBP2 mutation, with two of her cousins having been previously affected. The genetic result assisted with identification of at-risk family members, counseling and subsequent preventative measures including vaccination and early ANE ‘crisis’ management.

The MRI shows the classical symmetrical involvement of both thalami (with a target appearance) and symmetrical external capsular white matter affected. She had brainstem involvement (not shown) and was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone early. She survived with mild to moderate neurological sequelae. She was the first in her family to be genetically confirmed as positive for a RANBP2 mutation, with two of her cousins having been previously affected. The genetic result assisted with identification of at-risk family members, counseling and subsequent preventative measures including vaccination and early ANE ‘crisis’ management.

(Personal case of APN and JMW): Axial T-2 weighted MRI of a 9-year-old girl with who presented with classical clinical features of ANE and was admitted to the local paediatric intensive care unit. The MRI shows the classical symmetrical involvement of both thalami (with a target appearance) and symmetrical external capsular white matter affected. She had brainstem involvement (not shown) and was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone early. She survived with mild to moderate neurological sequelae. She was the first in her family to be genetically confirmed as positive for a RANBP2 mutation, with two of her cousins having been previously affected. The genetic result assisted with identification of at-risk family members, counseling and subsequent preventative measures including vaccination and early ANE ‘crisis’ management.

2. Acute Necrotizing Encephalopathy (Local case). (Personal case of APN and JMW): Axial T-2 weighted MRI of a 9-year-old girl with who presented with classical clinical features of ANE and was admitted to the local paediatric intensive care unit. The MRI shows the classical symmetrical involvement of both thalami (with a target appearance) and symmetrical external capsular white matter affected. She had brainstem involvement (not shown) and was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone early. She survived with mild to moderate neurological sequelae. She was the first in her family to be genetically confirmed as positive for a RANBP2 mutation, with two of her cousins having been previously affected. The genetic result assisted with identification of at-risk family members, counseling and subsequent preventative measures including vaccination and early ANE ‘crisis’ management.

This patient had an M371 level of relative quantity (RQ) = 1 and is continuously disease-free for 24 months. This figure illustrates that neither the imaging technique (i.e., MRI) nor the size of the residual mass (5 cm in this case) can safely predict the histology of the residual mass.
2. MRI of thoracic spine shows abnormal T2 signaling spanning from T2-T8, highly suspicious for an acute spinal cord infarction (focal cord swelling and ""pencil-like"" hyperintensities on T2-weighted images).
3. MRI with contrast (no significant findings)
4. Coronal T2 weighted MRI image showing myositis of right iliopsoas muscles (rightward orange arrow) with diffuse marrow hypointensity (downward orange arrow) secondary to lymphomatous infiltration.MRI - Magnetic Resonance Imaging
5. Acute Necrotizing Encephalopathy (Local case). (Personal case of APN and JMW): Axial T-2 weighted MRI of a 9-year-old girl with who presented with classical clinical features of ANE and was admitted to the local paediatric intensive care unit. The MRI shows the classical symmetrical involvement of both thalami (with a target appearance) and symmetrical external capsular white matter affected. She had brainstem involvement (not shown) and was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone early. She survived with mild to moderate neurological sequelae. She was the first in her family to be genetically confirmed as positive for a RANBP2 mutation, with two of her cousins having been previously affected. The genetic result assisted with identification of at-risk family members, counseling and subsequent preventative measures including vaccination and early ANE ‘crisis’ management.",0.0391,0.0055,0.0029,0.0021,0.1020,0.2583

- Thoracic computed tomography (CT) at day 9 after admission revealed a bilateral central pulmonary embolism.
- Contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the falciform ligament abscess at the time of the first admission. A 25-mm, enhanced mass containing small low-density areas was observed below the center of the diaphragm (white arrow)
- Chest computed tomography scan showing multiple bilateral bronchopulmonary infiltrates

4. A 46-year-old man with high-grade fever and chills. The axial contrast-enhanced CT shows significant right-sided pleural effusion with the near complete collapse of the right lung resulting in a shift of the heart and mediastinum to the left side. There is pleural thickening and enhancement. There is an extrapleural component within the adjacent chest wall with rim enhancement (arrow). Aspiration was performed under the guidance of ultrasonography, and diagnosis of empyema necessitans was made as a complication of Actinomyces Israelii.
