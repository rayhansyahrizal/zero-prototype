ROCOv2_2023_test_000160,XR,"Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the strongest known risk factor for active tuberculosis (TB), and the risk of developing active TB in people living with HIV (PLWH) is 15–22 times higher than in people without HIV [1]. Active TB may develop at any stage of HIV infection, but the risk correlates negatively with CD4+ cells count. TB is the leading cause of morbidity, hospitalisations, and mortality in PLWH [1]. There were 214,000 deaths due to TB among HIV-positive people in 2020 worldwide, which accounted for 31.5% of all HIV-related deaths [1,2]. Therefore, it is recommended to screen for TB in HIV-positive patients, and for HIV infection in newly diagnosed TB patients [3,4,5]. Around 16% of all PLWH do not know that they are infected with HIV [1], and about 25% of incident HIV patients present to care with advanced disease [3]. Immunosuppression caused by HIV infection affects clinical and radiologic presentation of TB. Atypical TB presentation is often observed in the late stages of HIV infection [6,7,8,9]. Such atypical TB presentation in a person with HIV infection not yet diagnosed, may be challenging, as described below.

3. Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the strongest known risk factor for active tuberculosis (TB), and the risk of developing active TB in people living with HIV (PLWH) is 15–22 times higher than in people without HIV [1]. Active TB may develop at any stage of HIV infection, but the risk correlates negatively with CD4+ cells count. TB is the leading cause of morbidity, hospitalisations, and mortality in PLWH [1]. There were 214,000 deaths due to TB among HIV-positive people in 2020 worldwide, which accounted for 31.5% of all HIV-related deaths [1,2]. Therefore, it is recommended to screen for TB in HIV-positive patients, and for HIV infection in newly diagnosed TB patients [3,4,5]. Around 16% of all PLWH do not know that they are infected with HIV [1], and about 25% of incident HIV patients present to care with advanced disease [3]. Immunosuppression caused by HIV infection affects clinical and radiologic presentation of TB. Atypical TB presentation is often observed in the late stages of HIV infection [6,7,8,9]. Such atypical TB presentation in a person with HIV infection not yet diagnosed, may be challenging, as described below.

There were 214,000 deaths due to TB among HIV-positive people in 2020 worldwide, which accounted for 31.5% of all HIV-related deaths [1,2].

There were 214,000 deaths due to TB among HIV-positive people in 2020 worldwide, which accounted for 31.5% of all HIV-related deaths [1,2]. Therefore, it is recommended to screen for TB in HIV-positive patients, and for HIV infection in newly diagnosed TB patients [3,4,5]. Around 16% of all PLWH do not know that they are infected with HIV [1], and about 25% of incident HIV patients present to care with advanced disease [3]. Immunosuppression caused by HIV infection affects clinical and radiologic presentation of TB. Atypical TB presentation is often observed in the late stages of HIV infection [6,7,8,9]. Such atypical TB presentation in a person with HIV infection not yet diagnosed, may be challenging, as described below.

- Absence of the septum pellucidum (white arrow) and pointing of frontal horns (yellow arrow) seen on MRI of the brain.
- Post-gadolinium axial magnetic resonance imaging of pelvis. The lesion in the right pelvic wall shows no marked enhancement by intravenous administration of gadolinium (yellow arrow)
- MRI shows the communication between the prostatic urethra and the cystic mass
- MRI of a typical residual mass resulting from chemotherapy of left-sided metastatic seminoma: 5 cm para-aortic mass (patient R8 in  Table 1 ). T1-weighted imaging, fat-weighted imaging, and T2-weighted imaging are shown in Figure 1","1.

4. MRI of a typical residual mass resulting from chemotherapy of left-sided metastatic seminoma: 5 cm para-aortic mass (patient R8 in  Table 1 ). T1-weighted imaging, fat-suppressed mode, coronal section. AA, abdominal aorta; IVC, inferior vena cava; LRV, left renal vein. Arrows denote the residual mass. This patient had an M371 level of relative quantity (RQ) = 1 and is continuously disease-free for 24 months. This figure illustrates that neither the imaging technique (i.e., MRI) nor the size of the residual mass (5 cm in this case) can safely predict the histology of the residual mass.
