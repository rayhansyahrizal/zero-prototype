5. Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the strongest known risk factor for active tuberculosis (TB), and the risk of developing active TB in people living with HIV (PLWH) is 15–22 times higher than in people without HIV [1]. Active TB may develop at any stage of HIV infection, but the risk correlates negatively with CD4+ cells count. TB is the leading cause of morbidity, hospitalisations, and mortality in PLWH [1]. There were 214,000 deaths due to TB among HIV-positive people in 2020 worldwide, which accounted for 31.5% of all HIV-related deaths [1,2]. Therefore, it is recommended to screen for TB in HIV-positive patients, and for HIV infection in newly diagnosed TB patients [3,4,5]. Around 16% of all PLWH do not know that they are infected with HIV [1], and about 25% of incident HIV patients present to care with advanced disease [3]. Immunosuppression caused by HIV infection affects clinical and radiologic presentation of TB. Atypical TB presentation is often observed in the late stages of HIV infection [6,7,8,9]. Such atypical TB presentation in a person with HIV infection not yet diagnosed, may be challenging, as described below.

4. Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the strongest known risk factor for active tuberculosis (TB), and the risk of developing active TB in people living with HIV (PLWH) is 15–22 times higher than in people without HIV [1]. Active TB may develop at any stage of HIV infection, but the risk correlates negatively with CD4+ cells count. TB is the leading cause of morbidity, hospitalisations, and mortality in PLWH [1]. There were 214,000 deaths due to TB among HIV-positive people in 2020 worldwide, which accounted for 31.5% of all HIV-related deaths [1,2]. Therefore, it is recommended to screen for TB in HIV-positive patients, and for HIV infection in newly diagnosed TB patients [3,4,5]. Around 16% of all PLWH do not know that they are infected with HIV [1], and about 25% of incident HIV patients present to care with advanced disease [3]. Immunosuppression caused by HIV infection affects clinical and radiologic presentation of TB. Atypical TB presentation is often observed in the late stages of HIV infection [6,7,8,9]. Such atypical TB presentation in a person with HIV infection not yet diagnosed, may be challenging, as described below.

Active TB may develop at any stage of HIV infection, but the risk correlates negatively with CD4+ cells count. TB is the leading cause of morbidity, hospitalisations, and mortality in PLWH [1]. There were 214,000 deaths due to TB among HIV-positive people in 2020 worldwide, which accounted for 31.5% of all HIV-related deaths [1,2]. Therefore, it is recommended to screen for TB in HIV-positive patients, and for HIV infection in newly diagnosed TB patients [3,4,5]. Around 16% of all PLWH do not know that they are infected with HIV [1], and about 25% of incident HIV patients present to care with advanced disease [3]. Immunosuppression caused by HIV infection affects clinical and radiologic presentation of TB. Atypical TB presentation is often observed in the late stages of HIV infection [6,7,8,9]. Such atypical TB presentation in a person with HIV infection not yet diagnosed, may be challenging, as described below. A 42-year-old woman of Indian origin was referred to a respiratory medicine department after her chest X-ray (Figure 1) revealed nodular opacifications in the lungs and bilateral pleural effusion (arrows). The patient had a 4-month history of unspecific chest and feet pains, mild dry cough, fatigue, reduced appetite, and body weight loss of 6 kg. She denied dyspnoea, sputum expectoration, haemoptysis, night sweats, or fever. On admission to the hospital, she was in good condition, her vital signs were normal, BMI was 19.2. There was no palpable peripheral lymphadenopathy or oedema; the vesicular breathing sound was reduced bibasiliary on chest auscultation. Blood tests showed elevated CRP—109.4 (N:<5) mg/L and ERS—120 (N: < 12), normal procalcitonin, normal leukocyte and neutrophil counts, decreased lymphocyte count—0.84 × 103 (N:1.18 × 103–3.74 × 103) cells/mm3.","Based on the context of similar medical images:

3. Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the strongest known risk factor for active tuberculosis (TB), and the risk of developing active TB in people living with HIV (PLWH) is 15–22 times higher than in people without HIV [1]. Active TB may develop at any stage of HIV infection, but the risk correlates negatively with CD4+ cells count. TB is the leading cause of morbidity, hospitalisations, and mortality in PLWH [1]. There were 214,000 deaths due to TB among HIV-positive people in 2020 worldwide, which accounted for 31.5% of all HIV-related deaths [1,2]. Therefore, it is recommended to screen for TB in HIV-positive patients, and for HIV infection in newly diagnosed TB patients [3,4,5]. Around 16% of all PLWH do not know that they are infected with HIV [1], and about 25% of incident HIV patients present to care with advanced disease [3]. Immunosuppression caused by HIV infection affects clinical and radiologic presentation of TB. Atypical TB presentation is often observed in the late stages of HIV infection [6,7,8,9]. Such atypical TB presentation in a person with HIV infection not yet diagnosed, may be challenging, as described below.

- Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the strongest known risk factor for active tuberculosis (TB), and the risk of developing active TB in people living with HIV (PLWH) is 15–22 times higher than in people without HIV [1]. Active TB may develop at any stage of HIV infection, but the risk correlates negatively with CD4+ cells count. TB is the leading cause of morbidity, hospitalisations, and mortality in PLWH [1]. There were 214,000 deaths due to TB among HIV-positive people in 2020 worldwide, which accounted for 31.5% of all HIV-related deaths [1,2]. Therefore, it is important to understand the risk factors for active TB in PLWH.","1. Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the strongest known risk factor for active tuberculosis (TB), and the risk of developing active TB in people living with HIV (PLWH) is 15–22 times higher than in people without HIV [1]. Active TB may develop at any stage of HIV infection, but the risk correlates negatively with CD4+ cells count. TB is the leading cause of morbidity, hospitalisations, and mortality in PLWH [1]. There were 214,000 deaths due to TB among HIV-positive people in 2020 worldwide, which accounted for 31.5% of all HIV-related deaths [1,2]. Therefore, it is recommended to screen for TB in HIV-positive patients, and for HIV infection in newly diagnosed TB patients [3,4,5]. Around 16% of all PLWH do not know that they are infected with HIV [1], and about 25% of incident HIV patients present to care with advanced disease [3]. Immunosuppression caused by HIV infection affects clinical and radiologic presentation of TB. Atypical TB presentation is often observed in the late stages of HIV infection [6,7,8,9]. Such atypical TB presentation in a person with HIV infection not yet diagnosed, may be challenging, as described below. A 42-year-old woman of Indian origin was referred to a respiratory medicine department after her chest X-ray (Figure 1) revealed nodular opacifications in the lungs and bilateral pleural effusion (arrows). The patient had a 4-month history of unspecific chest and feet pains, mild dry cough, fatigue, reduced appetite, and body weight loss of 6 kg. She denied dyspnoea, sputum expectoration, haemoptysis, night sweats, or fever. On admission to the hospital, she was in good condition, her vital signs were normal, BMI was 19.2. There was no palpable peripheral lymphadenopathy or oedema; the vesicular breathing sound was reduced bibasiliary on chest auscultation. Blood tests showed elevated CRP—109.4 (N:<5) mg/L and ERS—120 (N: < 12), normal procalcitonin, normal leukocyte and neutrophil counts, decreased lymphocyte count—0.84 × 103 (N:1.18 × 103–3.74 × 103) cells/mm3.

3. Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the strongest known risk factor for active tuberculosis (TB), and the risk of developing active TB in people living with HIV (PLWH) is 15–22 times higher than in people without HIV [1]. Active TB may develop at any stage of HIV infection, but the risk correlates negatively with CD4+ cells count. TB is the leading cause of morbidity, hospitalisations, and mortality in PLWH [1]. There were 214,000 deaths due to TB among HIV-positive people in 2020 worldwide, which accounted for 31.5% of all HIV-related deaths [1,2]. Therefore, it is recommended to screen for TB in HIV-positive patients, and for HIV infection in newly diagnosed TB patients [3,4,5]. Around 16% of all PLWH do not know that they are infected with HIV [1], and about 25% of incident HIV patients present to care with advanced disease [3]. Immunosuppression caused by HIV infection affects clinical and radiologic presentation of TB. Atypical TB presentation is often observed in the late stages of HIV infection [6,7,8,9]. Such atypical TB presentation in a person with HIV infection not yet diagnosed, may be challenging, as described below.

3. Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the strongest known risk factor for active tuberculosis (TB), and the risk of developing active TB in people living with HIV (PLWH) is 15–22 times higher than in people without HIV [1]. Active TB may develop at any stage of HIV infection, but the risk correlates negatively with CD4+ cells count. TB is the leading cause of morbidity, hospitalisations, and mortality in PLWH [1]. There were 214,000 deaths due to TB among HIV-positive people in 2020 worldwide, which accounted for 31.5% of all HIV-related deaths [1,2]. Therefore, it is recommended to screen for TB in HIV-positive patients, and for HIV infection in newly diagnosed TB patients [3,4,5]. Around 16% of all PLWH do not know that they are infected with HIV [1], and about 25% of incident HIV patients present to care with advanced disease [3]. Immunosuppression caused by HIV infection affects clinical and radiologic presentation of TB. Atypical TB presentation is often observed in the late stages of HIV infection [6,7,8,9]. Such atypical TB presentation in a person with HIV infection not yet diagnosed, may be challenging, as described below.

5. Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the strongest known risk factor for active tuberculosis (TB), and the risk of developing active TB in people living with HIV (PLWH) is 15–22 times higher than in people without HIV [1]. Active TB may develop at any stage of HIV infection, but the risk correlates negatively with CD4+ cells count. TB is the leading cause of morbidity, hospitalisations, and mortality in PLWH [1]. There were 214,000 deaths due to TB among HIV-positive people in 2020 worldwide, which accounted for 31.5% of all HIV-related deaths [1,2]. Therefore, it is recommended to screen for TB in HIV-positive patients, and for HIV infection in newly diagnosed TB patients [3,4,5]. Around 16% of all PLWH do not know that they are infected with HIV [1], and about 25% of incident HIV patients present to care with advanced disease [3]. Immunosuppression caused by HIV infection affects clinical and radiologic presentation of TB. Atypical TB presentation is often observed in the late stages of HIV infection [6,7,8,9]. Such atypical TB presentation in a person with HIV infection not yet diagnosed, may be challenging, as described below. A 42-year-old woman of Indian origin was referred to a respiratory medicine department after her chest X-ray (Figure 1) revealed nodular opacifications in the lungs and bilateral pleural effusion (arrows).

3. Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the strongest known risk factor for active tuberculosis (TB), and the risk of developing active TB in people living with HIV (PLWH) is 15–22 times higher than in people without HIV [1]. Active TB may develop at any stage of HIV infection, but the risk correlates negatively with CD4+ cells count. TB is the leading cause of morbidity, hospitalisations, and mortality in PLWH [1]. There were 214,000 deaths due to TB among HIV-positive people in 2020 worldwide, which accounted for 31.5% of all HIV-related deaths [1,2]. Therefore, it is recommended to screen for TB in HIV-positive patients, and for HIV infection in newly diagnosed TB patients [3,4,5]. Around 16% of all PLWH do not know that they are infected with HIV [1], and about 25% of incident HIV patients present to care with advanced disease [3]. Immunosuppression caused by HIV infection affects clinical and radiologic presentation of TB. Atypical TB presentation is often observed in the late stages of HIV infection [6,7,8,9]. Such atypical TB presentation in a person with HIV infection not yet diagnosed, may be challenging, as described below.

5. Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the strongest known risk factor for active tuberculosis (TB), and the risk of developing active TB in people living with HIV (PLWH) is 15–22 times higher than in people without HIV [1]. Active TB may develop at any stage of HIV infection, but the risk correlates negatively with CD4+ cells count. TB is the leading cause of morbidity, hospitalisations, and mortality in PLWH [1]. There were 214,000 deaths due to TB among HIV-positive people in 2020 worldwide, which accounted for 31.5% of all HIV-related deaths [1,2]. Therefore, it is recommended to screen for TB in HIV-positive patients, and for HIV infection in newly diagnosed TB patients [3,4,5]. Around 16% of all PLWH do not know that they are infected with HIV [1], and about 25% of incident HIV patients present to care with advanced disease [3]. Immunosuppression caused by HIV infection affects clinical and radiologic presentation of TB. Atypical TB presentation is often observed in the late stages of HIV infection [6,7,8,9]. Such atypical TB presentation in a person with HIV infection not yet diagnosed, may be challenging, as described below.

- Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the strongest known risk factor for active tuberculosis (TB), and the risk of developing active TB in people living with HIV (PLWH) is 15–22 times higher than in people without HIV [1]. Active TB may develop at any stage of HIV infection, but the risk correlates negatively with CD4+ cells count. TB is the leading cause of morbidity, hospitalisations, and mortality in PLWH [1]. There were 214,000 deaths due to TB among HIV-positive people in 2020 worldwide, which accounted for 31.5% of all HIV-related deaths [1,2]. Therefore, it is important to understand the risk factors for active TB in PLWH.","1. Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the strongest known risk factor for active tuberculosis (TB), and the risk of developing active TB in people living with HIV (PLWH) is 15–22 times higher than in people without HIV [1]. Active TB may develop at any stage of HIV infection, but the risk correlates negatively with CD4+ cells count. TB is the leading cause of morbidity, hospitalisations, and mortality in PLWH [1]. There were 214,000 deaths due to TB among HIV-positive people in 2020 worldwide, which accounted for 31.5% of all HIV-related deaths [1,2]. Therefore, it is recommended to screen for TB in HIV-positive patients, and for HIV infection in newly diagnosed TB patients [3,4,5]. Around 16% of all PLWH do not know that they are infected with HIV [1], and about 25% of incident HIV patients present to care with advanced disease [3]. Immunosuppression caused by HIV infection affects clinical and radiologic presentation of TB. Atypical TB presentation is often observed in the late stages of HIV infection [6,7,8,9]. Such atypical TB presentation in a person with HIV infection not yet diagnosed, may be challenging, as described below. A 42-year-old woman of Indian origin was referred to a respiratory medicine department after her chest X-ray (Figure 1) revealed nodular opacifications in the lungs and bilateral pleural effusion (arrows).

4. Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the strongest known risk factor for active tuberculosis (TB), and the risk of developing active TB in people living with HIV (PLWH) is 15–22 times higher than in people without HIV [1]. Active TB may develop at any stage of HIV infection, but the risk correlates negatively with CD4+ cells count. TB is the leading cause of morbidity, hospitalisations, and mortality in PLWH [1]. There were 214,000 deaths due to TB among HIV-positive people in 2020 worldwide, which accounted for 31.5% of all HIV-related deaths [1,2]. Therefore, it is recommended to screen for TB in HIV-positive patients, and for HIV infection in newly diagnosed TB patients [3,4,5]. Around 16% of all PLWH do not know that they are infected with HIV [1], and about 25% of incident HIV patients present to care with advanced disease [3]. Immunosuppression caused by HIV infection affects clinical and radiologic presentation of TB. Atypical TB presentation is often observed in the late stages of HIV infection [6,7,8,9]. Such atypical TB presentation in a person with HIV infection not yet diagnosed, may be challenging, as described below. A 42-year-old woman of Indian origin was referred to a respiratory medicine department after her chest X-ray (Figure 1) revealed nodular opacifications in the lungs and bilateral pleural effusion (arrows).

4. Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the strongest known risk factor for active tuberculosis (TB), and the risk of developing active TB in people living with HIV (PLWH) is 15–22 times higher than in people without HIV [1]. Active TB may develop at any stage of HIV infection, but the risk correlates negatively with CD4+ cells count. TB is the leading cause of morbidity, hospitalisations, and mortality in PLWH [1]. There were 214,000 deaths due to TB among HIV-positive people in 2020 worldwide, which accounted for 31.5% of all HIV-related deaths [1,2]. Therefore, it is recommended to screen for TB in HIV-positive patients, and for HIV infection in newly diagnosed TB patients [3,4,5]. Around 16% of all PLWH do not know that they are infected with HIV [1], and about 25% of incident HIV patients present to care with advanced disease [3]. Immunosuppression caused by HIV infection affects clinical and radiologic presentation of TB. Atypical TB presentation is often observed in the late stages of HIV infection [6,7,8,9]. Such atypical TB presentation in a person with HIV infection not yet diagnosed, may be challenging, as described below.

- Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the strongest known risk factor for active tuberculosis (TB), and the risk of developing active TB in people living with HIV (PLWH) is 15–22 times higher than in people without HIV [1]. Active TB may develop at any stage of HIV infection, but the risk correlates negatively with CD4+ cells count. TB is the leading cause of morbidity, hospitalisations, and mortality in PLWH [1]. There were 214,000 deaths due to TB among HIV-positive people in 2020 worldwide, which accounted for 31.5% of all HIV-related deaths [1,2]. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the risk of developing active TB in PLWH is higher than in the general population.","1. Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the strongest known risk factor for active tuberculosis (TB), and the risk of developing active TB in people living with HIV (PLWH) is 15–22 times higher than in people without HIV [1]. Active TB may develop at any stage of HIV infection, but the risk correlates negatively with CD4+ cells count. TB is the leading cause of morbidity, hospitalisations, and mortality in PLWH [1]. There were 214,000 deaths due to TB among HIV-positive people in 2020 worldwide, which accounted for 31.5% of all HIV-related deaths [1,2]. Therefore, it is recommended to screen for TB in HIV-positive patients, and for HIV infection in newly diagnosed TB patients [3,4,5]. Around 16% of all PLWH do not know that they are infected with HIV [1], and about 25% of incident HIV patients present to care with advanced disease [3]. Immunosuppression caused by HIV infection affects clinical and radiologic presentation of TB. Atypical TB presentation is often observed in the late stages of HIV infection [6,7,8,9]. Such atypical TB presentation in a person with HIV infection not yet diagnosed, may be challenging, as described below. A 42-year-old woman of Indian origin was referred to a respiratory medicine department after her chest X-ray (Figure 1) revealed nodular opacifications in the lungs and bilateral pleural effusion (arrows).

She denied dyspnoea, sputum expectoration, haemoptysis, night sweats, or fever. On admission to the hospital, she was in good condition, her vital signs were normal, BMI was 19.2. There was no palpable peripheral lymphadenopathy or oedema; the vesicular breathing sound was reduced bibasiliary on chest auscultation.

3. Acute Necrotizing Encephalopathy (Local case). (Personal case of APN and JMW): Axial T-2 weighted MRI of a 9-year-old girl with who presented with classical clinical features of ANE and was admitted to the local paediatric intensive care unit. The MRI shows the classical symmetrical involvement of both thalami (with a target appearance) and symmetrical external capsular white matter affected. She had brainstem involvement (not shown) and was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone early. She survived with mild to moderate neurological sequelae. She was the first in her family to be genetically confirmed as positive for a RANBP2 mutation, with two of her cousins having been previously affected. The genetic result assisted with identification of at-risk family members, counseling and subsequent preventative measures including vaccination and early ANE ‘crisis’ management.
